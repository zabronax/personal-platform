# DR-0001-Technology Outline

## Context

The Personal Platform covers multiple user interfaces, services, autonomous systems, provisioning, governance, and storage. This requires a diverse technology stack. Here's the initial selection with tradeoff notes. This is an outline and will likely change.

## User Interfaces

The platform needs to provide consistent, functional user experiences across multiple device types and interaction patterns. Users expect seamless transitions between web browsers, native applications, wearable devices, and command-line tools. Each interface type has unique constraints around screen size, input methods, and performance requirements. We need a unified approach that maintains design consistency while leveraging platform-specific capabilities.

**Selected**:

- React, as the baseline
- NextJS, for web targets due to broad rendering strategy support
- Tauri, for cross-platform native development
- Kotlin, for WearOS targets (Rust frameworks may support this in the future)
- Storybook, for design system implementation
- Penpot, as graphical design software for design systems

## Backend

The backend must support both traditional containerized deployments and emerging WebAssembly-based architectures. The system needs to handle complex resource management, service orchestration, and autonomous decision-making processes. We require a foundation that can scale from embedded systems to cloud deployments while maintaining performance and reliability across diverse hardware configurations.

**Selected**:

- Rust, due to broad applicability
- Haskell, for abstraction power in DSL development (limited to targeted use cases)

## Data Management

Data flows through the system in multiple formats and patterns, requiring both real-time processing and long-term storage. We need to handle event streams, relational data, spatial information, and semantic relationships while maintaining data integrity and enabling efficient querying. The system must support both structured and unstructured data with appropriate indexing and caching strategies.

**Selected**:

- SurrealDB, a multi-modal distributed database
- SQLite, for small, tightly-bounded use cases
- SeaweedFS, LAS and CAS cloud-native blob storage

## Interface/Contract Definition

As the system spans multiple languages and platforms, we need standardized ways to define interfaces, data contracts, and communication protocols. This includes both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns, binary and text-based formats, and configuration management. The chosen formats must have broad ecosystem support and tooling.

**Selected**:

- OpenAPI, for HTTP request/reply patterns
- AsyncAPI, for other HTTP patterns
- Protobuf, for binary inter-service communication
- JSON & YAML, for configurations (JSONSchema for validation)

## Artifact Composition

Building and deploying the system requires reproducible, deterministic processes that work across different environments. We need to manage dependencies, build artifacts, and deployment configurations in a way that ensures consistency between development, testing, and production environments.

**Selected**:

- Nix with flakes, for deterministic builds and functional composition across distributables, deployables, and development environments

## Infrastructure

The platform requires both self-hosted infrastructure and integration with external services. We need declarative configuration management that can handle complex deployment scenarios, service discovery, and resource provisioning. The infrastructure must support both traditional and cloud-native deployment patterns.

**Selected**:

- OpenTofu (Terraform fork), for external services
- Kubernetes (Talos + FluxCD), for subsystems requiring cybernetic controls

## Documentation

Documentation must serve multiple audiences including developers, operators, and end users. It needs to be maintainable, searchable, and accessible across different contexts. The documentation system should support both human-readable content and machine-processable metadata.

**Selected**:

- Markdown with frontmatter metadata, simple and easy to use
- HTML, for content requiring more semantic structure

## Policies

The system needs to enforce various policies around access control, resource usage, data handling, and operational procedures. These policies must be centrally managed but distributed across enforcement points. The policy system should be flexible enough to handle complex business rules while remaining performant.

**Selected**:

- Rego and Open Policy Agent, broad support for policies and most enforcement points

## Identities

Identity management is critical for security and access control across all system components. We need to support both human users and system identities, handle authentication and authorization, and integrate with external identity providers. The identity system must be flexible enough to support various trust models and federation scenarios.

**Selected**:

- JSON Web Tokens, for communicating identities and claims in standardized format
- OIDC, for outsourcing identity governance to external services
- X509, for heavy chain-of-trust scenarios
- SPIFFE, for defining system identities

## Telemetry

Operational visibility is essential for monitoring, debugging, and optimization. We need comprehensive observability across all system components, including logs, metrics, and distributed traces. The telemetry system must support both real-time monitoring and historical analysis while being efficient and non-intrusive.

**Selected**:

- OpenTelemetry, emerging standard for logs, metrics, and traces

## Secrets

The system needs to manage sensitive information including credentials, keys, and configuration secrets. These secrets must be securely stored, rotated regularly, and distributed to the appropriate components. The secret management system should support both embedded secrets in version control and external vault services.

**Selected**:

- SOPS, for managing sealed secrets embedded in the repository
- Age, as the cryptographic backend providing simplified interface compared to GPG
- 1Password, as external vault service for non-embedded secrets
